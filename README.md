# Bachelor Thesis
I recently completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics.
For my thesis I explored a way to augment Bayesian optimization, which is an algorithm designed to optimize over Gaussian random fields.

You can find [the full PDF version here](Bachelorarbeit/main.pdf), as well as the LaTeX source code [in this folder](Bachelorarbeit/). Below are some screenshots of graphics explaining Bayesian optimization and Gaussian Process Regression.
